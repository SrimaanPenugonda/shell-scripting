created self hosted agent - followed steps in azure doc
and configured that to workstation linux machine - centos

myagent - dir will be created
run - sh svc.sh install
      sh svc.sh start
this will start the self agent

now create pipeline and add agent job using self hosted one (default) which has our agent in agent pool

now add required tasks to agent job
1 . terraform
2. bash - where we give our bash commands
    make dev-init

3.azure has to link our aws configure - aws creditionals
    create a variable library
        give AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
             AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
4. now linke these variables to our pipeline for all releases
5.under bash env varibale willbe there pass above variables here $(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID) and $(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

5.create vpc and subnets(2public and 2 private)
6.create internet gateway and nat gateway
    NAT Gateway (PRIVATE SUBNETS) - Network Address Translation Gateway its enable private subnet to connect to the internet
    or other AWS services,but it prevent internet from initiating a connection with it directly
        - Create a NAT in public subnet assign it to EIP and associate this with your private subnet using route table-
            which point the internet traffic to NAT
7.nat gateway requires EIP elastic ip address
